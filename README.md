# QuickBite - Food Delivery App

### Project Purpose & Overview

QuickBite is a food delivery application designed to make ordering food from local restaurants fast, easy, and efficient. The app allows users to browse nearby restaurants, view menus, place orders, and track deliveries in real-time. With features such as user authentication, order history, and restaurant recommendations, QuickBite aims to streamline the food ordering process for both customers and restaurant owners. This project will focus on building a robust API using Express.js, MongoDB, and JWT authentication.

Routes:

- Set up routes for users (/api/users), restaurants (/api/restaurants), and orders (/api/orders).

Middleware:

- Created authentication middleware to secure routes requiring logged-in users.

Database:

- MongoDB collections are created for Users, Restaurants, and Orders.

### Next Steps for Project Completion:

Enhance Features:

- Implement PUT/PATCH routes for updating user profiles and orders.

- Integrate payment gateway for real-world transactions.

- Develop functionality for users to add restaurants to their favorites list.

Testing & Debugging:

- Perform API testing using Postman or Insomnia.

Frontend Development:

- Create a user interface for the app using React.js.

- Integrate frontend with the backend API.

Deployment:
